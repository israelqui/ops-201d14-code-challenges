@echo off 
:: command use to hide commmands in the script. only results are shown.

setlocal enabledelayedexpansion 
:: enable delayed varianle expansion. allows variables to be expanded at a later time, typically inside loops or conditional statements, rather than immediatly when the script is parsed.

set /p sourcePath=Enter the source folder path: 
:: asks the user to input a folder path. It creates a variable named sourcePath to store the user's input. The message "Enter the source folder path:" is displayed to instruct the user on what to enter, and the value they input is stored in the sourcePath variable for further use within the script. 

set /p destinationPath=Enter the destination folder path:
:: prompts the user to input a folder path. It creates a variable named destinationPath to store the user's input. The message "Enter the destination folder path:" serves as an instruction to the user, and the value they enter is stored in the destinationPath variable for later use within the script. This is often used for taking user input, such as specifying source and destination paths for file operations.

if not exist "!sourcePath!\" (
:: is the start of a conditional statement. It checks whether the directory specified by the user in the variable sourcePath exists. If it doesn't exist, the code inside the parentheses will be executed to handle this situation. This is commonly used to account for cases where the specified source directory is missing. 
    echo Error: Source folder does not exist.
    :: a command that It is typically placed inside the code block of an "if" statement. This line serves to display an error message to the user when the source folder, as specified in the sourcePath variable, does not exist. In this case, the message "Error: Source folder does not exist." will be displayed in the console or command prompt, informing the user that the source folder they provided is not found. This is a common practice in batch scripting to provide feedback to users when an expected condition is not met.
    goto :eof
    :: exit or terminate the script. Specifically, it's used to jump to the :eof label, which is a special label indicating the end of the script. This effectively ends the execution of the script and exits the batch file. In batch scripting, :eof is a predefined label that doesn't contain any actual code or commands. Instead, it's used as a marker to signify the end of the script. When the goto :eof command is encountered in the script, it acts as a way to immediately exit the script, regardless of where it appears in the code. if the source folder doesn't exist, the script displays an error message and then jumps to :eof, effectively ending the script. If the source folder does exist, the script continues executing the commands that follow the if statement.
)
:: The closing parenthesis is used to mark the end of a code block, often used in conjunction with an "if" statement. In this context it closes the code block that began with if not exist "!sourcePath!\" ( and typically contains code to be executed when the specified condition is met. In this case, the code block is closed after displaying the error message, and it's executed when the source folder doesn't exist, providing feedback to the user. This code is typically used to handle cases where the destination directory specified by the user does not exist, and you can then define actions to be taken within the code block (inside the parentheses) to handle this situation.

if not exist "!destinationPath!\" (
    :: very similar to the previous if statement but relates to the destination folder path, specified by the destinationPath variable. It is the start of another conditional statement in a Windows batch script.
    echo Error: Destination folder does not exist.
    :: It is typically placed inside the code block of an "if" statement, to display an error message to the user when the destination folder, as specified in the destinationPath variable, does not exist. The message "Error: Destination folder does not exist." will be displayed in the console or command prompt, informing the user that the destination folder they provided is not found. This is a common practice in batch scripting to provide feedback to users when an expected condition is not met, in this case, when the destination folder is missing.
    goto :eof
    :: The same as the prvious one. if the destination folder doesn't exist, the script displays an error message and then jumps to :eof, effectively ending the script. If the destination folder does exist, the script continues executing the commands that follow the "if" statement.
)
:: the end of a code block within an "if" statement. In this context, it closes the code block that started with if not exist "!destinationPath!\" ( and typically contains commands or actions to be executed when the specified condition is met. In this script, when the condition inside the "if not exist" statement is true (meaning the destination folder doesn't exist), the code block enclosed by the parentheses is executed. This block may include commands like displaying an error message and exiting the script. The closing parenthesis signifies the end of this code block, and the script continues with any commands following it.

robocopy "!sourcePath!" "!destinationPath!" /E
:: this command copies all files and directories from the source path specified by the user to the destination path. It ensures that subdirectories and empty directories are also copied as part of the operation. This is a common command used for file backup, synchronization, and directory mirroring in batch scripts.

if errorlevel 8 (
:: This construct is typically used to handle errors or specific conditions in a batch script. If the exit code from the previous command is 8 or greater, the code inside the block (within the parentheses) will be executed to perform error handling or other actions.
    echo Error: ROBOCOPY encountered errors during the copy operation.
    :: It's used to display an error message when the robocopy command encountered errors during the copy operation. when the "if" condition is met (i.e., when the errorlevel is 8 or greater, indicating an error in the robocopy operation), this line is executed to provide feedback to the user. The message "Error: ROBOCOPY encountered errors during the copy operation." is displayed in the console or command prompt to inform the user about the issue. Common practice in batch scripting to handle and report errors or unexpected conditions in a user-friendly way.
) else (
:: ignifies the beginning of the "else" part of the conditional statement. this construct allows you to specify different actions or commands to be executed based on whether the condition in the "if" statement is true or false. When the "if" condition is true, the code block after the if is executed. When the "if" condition is false, the code block following the else is executed. In this bat script when the robocopy operation results in an exit code of 8 or greater, indicating an error, the "if" block is executed, displaying an error message. When the exit code is less than 8 (no error), the "else" block is executed, indicating a successful operation.
    echo Copy operation completed successfully.
    :: It's used to display a success message when the robocopy operation (or other operation being checked) completes without errors. In the script, this line is executed when the "if" condition is not met (i.e., when the errorlevel is less than 8, indicating a successful operation). The message "Copy operation completed successfully" is displayed in the console or command prompt to inform the user that the copy operation finished without errors. This provides positive feedback in contrast to an error message when things go as expected.
)
:: It pairs with the opening parenthesis ( that starts the "else" code block. In the script, when the "if" condition is not met, the code block enclosed by the parentheses after the else is executed, and it ends with this closing parenthesis.

:end
::  a marker for a specific location within the script. It's not a command but a way to define a label that can be used as a reference point. This label can be used in conjunction with the goto command to jump to that specific location in the script. For example, you might use :end as a label to mark the end of your script, and then you can use goto :end to terminate the script and exit. This can be especially useful when you want to ensure a specific cleanup or finalization step is performed before the script exits. In this script, the :end label marks the end of the script, and the goto :eof command is used to jump to the predefined :eof label to exit the script. This ensures that the "Finalization steps" are performed before the script ends.
endlocal
:: used to terminate a local environment context created by the setlocal command, restoring the global environment and reverting any changes made within the local context, such as variable values, to their previous state. This ensures that changes are isolated to specific parts of the script and do not affect the broader environment.
